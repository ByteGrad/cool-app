  showcase project

  mention main concepts
    routing
    server components
      by default in Vite everything is client component, all components are loaded on the client
      all components are server components by default in Next.js
      server components only run on the server
        examples:
          1) fetch data (GET)
            without useEffect()
            show fetch()
            show prisma
          2) keep large dependency on server
            example: code highlighting
            show what happens in browser when I make it client component
          we can do anything we can usually do on the server,
            like access the file system, and more
      bc of these benefits best to keep a component a server component
        but sometimes not possible: when e.g. using onClick
    data fetching again (GET)
      Suspense and streaming
    server actions (POST / PUT / DELETE)
      revalidate
      loading state
    typical folder structure

  server actions
routing and navigation
  layout and pages
  dynamic routes
  route groups
metadata
styling
<Image /> and <Link /> components

  show useState won't work in server component
  show that adding more server components doesn't increase bundle size
  show that adding more client components does increase bundle size
  "use client" boundary
  server components inside client components (e.g. context API)
data fetching
  console log on server means looking into terminal
  loading.tsx
  mention pre-rendering on /id page
folder structure
Suspense and streaming
caching
static and dynamic rendering
  static at build time
  dynamic at request time
prisma setup
server actions
  add form in page component
  add server action within page component ("use server")
  refactor into separate component later
  revalidation
  loading state
/api routes
  webhook
middleware
  auth

empathize with difficulties
  pitch course

deploy
  static export
  local build and next start
  server-side features
